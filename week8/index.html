        <h2>HTML & CSS3 FOR THE REAL WORLD: 2ND EDITION</h2>
        <h3>Chapter 8: Transforms and Transitions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Translation - a function that allows elements to move left, right, up, or down</li>
            <li>Translation doesn't impact the flow of the document</li>
            <li>Translated elements can only be moved relative to its current position.</li>
            <li>translate(x,y) moves an element up and down, left and right. Example of this: transform: translate(45px,
                -45px);</li>
            <li>if you only want to move element up or down you use => transform: translateY(-30px); </li>
            <li>to only move an element left and right you use => transform: translateX(45px);</li>
            <br>
            <li>Scaling - a function that scales an element by its horizontal and vertical factors. looks like this =>
                scale(x,y)</li>
            <li>If you only include one element in the scale parameters then both x and y will be affected. If 2 numbers
                that are different are used then it will likely distort the element. Example => transform: scale(1.5,
                0.25);</li>
            <li>Translate and scale can both be used at the same time in transform. Example => transform:
                translateX(40px) scale(1.5);</li>
            <br>
            <li>Rotation - a function that rotates an element around the point of origin</li>
            <li>Here is an example of all 3 functions being used together => transform: rotate(10deg)
                translateX(40px) scale(1.5);
            </li>
            <li>Skew is used to make kind of a diagnol. It skews the element along the x and y axis</li>
            <li>transform-orgin - can control the origin point at where the element is transformed</li>
            <li>It matters the order in which you place the transform functions. Here is a direct quote from the
                chapter to better explain. "The order of transform functions does matter: if you rotate before
                translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis. The rightmost square in Figure
                8.8 was translated then rotated with transform: translateX(200px) rotate(135deg);. The leftmost
                square was rotated first then translated along the newly rotated axis: transform: rotate(135deg)
                translateX(200px);."</li>
            <br>
            <li>Transitions - used to animate elements</li>

            <li>Steps the chapter describes to create simple transition in CSS: </li>
            <ol>
                <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>
                <li>Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>
                <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties,
                    including: transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and
                    transition-delay. We’ll
                    look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>
            </ol>

            <li>transition-property - defines the CSS properties of an element that can be transitioned (this is set as
                "all" for default)</li>
            <li>transition-duration - how long the transition will take. it is best to get in the habit of using
                milliseconds(ms) for this since that is all that Javascript can take. (CSS can do seconds and
                milliseconds)</li>
            <li>Example of seconds => transition-duration: 0.2s;</li>
            <li>transition-timing-function - controls the pace of the transition with even greater detail</li>
            <li>Here are some common timing function => ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, or ease-in-out</li>
            <li>cubic-bezier - used to precisely define timing function. Linear Example => cubic-bezier(0, 0, 1, 1)
            </li>
            <li>transition-delay - delays the transition to start when you tell it to</li>
            <br>
            <li>Animation Properties:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>animation-name</li>
                <li>animation-duration</li>
                <li>animation-timing-function</li>
                <li>animation-iteration-count</li>
                <li>animation-direction</li>
                <li>animation-fill-mode</li>
                <li>animation-play-state</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chapter 12: Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
        <h4>Canvas</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Canvas is an HTML element that can be drawn on using Javascript</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>SVG</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Scalable Vector Graphics - a file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML</li>
            <li>drawing SVG images from hand can be complex. here is an opensource website to make SVG's <a
                    href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a></li>
            <li>Raphaël is an open-source JavaScript library that makes drawing and animating with SVG much
                easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Drag and Drop</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Drag and Drop is an API that allows us to specify what elements are draggable. These elements can then
                be dropped into elements on the page</li>
            <li>Steps to add Drap and Drop to your page:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Set the draggable attribute on any HTML elements you’d like to be draggable</li>
                <li>Add an event listener for the dragstart event on any draggable HTML elements.</li>
                <li>Add an event listener for the dragover and drop events on any elements that you want to have accept
                    dropped items.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

        <h3>Chapter 10: Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>System Error: The system or external device has a problem</li>
            <li>Programmer Error: There is a syntax error or typo or logic error in the code</li>

            <li>User Error: User has entered data incorrectly</li>
            <li>Exception: Will return a value that tells the programmer there is an error</li>
            <li>Stack Trace: sequence of functions that lead to where the error occured</li>
            <li>Warnings: Shows that there is an error in the code but it isn't bad enough to cause the code to crash
            </li>
            <li>Strict Mode: shows the programmer more warnings so that they can write less sloppy code</li>
            <li>Linting Mode: highlights sloppy programming habbits or syntax</li>
            <li>Modernizr and Can I Use? are libraries that detect what features are supported in different browsers
            </li>
            <li>Alert() is a function that stops the code from running until you press OK</li>
            <li>Breakpoints are a tool that pause your code at certain points. Firefox, Edge, Chrome, and Safari all use
                this tool.</li>

            <li>There are error objects that can be used for specific errors. They can also be used as contructors to
                create custom error objects. These objects are:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>EvalError</li>
                <li>RangeError</li>
                <li>ReferenceError</li>
                <li>SyntaxError</li>
                <li>TypeError</li>
                <li>URIError</li>
                <li>InternalError</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Throwing Exceptions: You can throw your own exceptions to highlight problems in your code</li>
            <li>Try, Catch, and Finally are used to expection handle your code</li>
            <li>Tests are a good way to make sure your code doesn't run when it is not supposed to. It can also show you
                errors that could potentially cause a problem in the future.</li>
            <li>TDD - Test-Driven Development</li>
            <li>Jest is a TDD framework that makes it easy to run texts by making helper functions for common tests</li>
        </ul>

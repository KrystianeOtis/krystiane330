        <h3>Chapter 11: Further Functions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All functions have a length property that returns the number of parameters that the function has</li>
            <li>The call() method can set the value of `this` inside a function to an object if it is the first argument
            </li>
            <li>The call() method will take the value of `this` and use it in the function</li>
            <li>If any other arguments need to be called in the parameters then they must be provided after the first
                argument</li>
            <li>If there aren't any objects that `this` will be refering to then the first argument will need to be
                provided as null</li>
            <li>If data is being used in an argument formatted as an array then you can use the apply() method</li>
            <li>It is possible to create your own properties to a function</li>
            <li>Memoization - result caching</li>
            <li>Result caching is useful because it can save a result and call it again without computing it again,
                saving time</li>
            <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression (or IIFE - pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function. They are
                useful because you can wrap variables up within the scope of the function</li>
            <li>Variables cannot be removed from a scope once they are declared. If you need to use a temporary variable
                then it is best to use an IIFE because once the function is done then it will disapear</li>
            <li>An IIFE can set up variables, objects, and event handlers when a page loads</li>
            <li>Using strict mode can be tricky so it is best to place 'use strict' inside an IIFE</li>
            <li>An IIFE can add or remove code seperately by enclosing code inside of its own private block</li>
            <li>Anonymous functions can define and rewrite themselves</li>
            <li>Init-Time Branching - enables functions to work more effectively in the browser and avoid checking for
                features everytime they are called</li>
            <li>Recursive Functions - Invokes itself until a certain condition is met. This is useful when iterating
            </li>
            <li>Callback Hell - Tangled mess of code <a href="http://callbackhell.com/">Visit this site for more
                    info</a></li>
            <li>Promises - Resolved: completed successfully || Rejected: was not completed successfully or resulted in
                an error</li>
            <li>Functions can return functions</li>
            <li>A Closure: a reference to a variable that was created inside the scope of another function, but is then
                kept alive and used in another part of the program</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chapter 13: AJAX</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AJAX is an acronym for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML</li>
            <li>Asynchronous
                When a request for data is sent, the program doesnâ€™t have to stop and wait for the response. It can
                carry on running, waiting for an event to fire when a response is received. By using callbacks to manage
                this, programs are able to run in an efficient way, avoiding lag as data is transferred back and forth.
            </li>
            <li>JavaScript
                JavaScript was always considered a 'front-end' language, not used to communicate with the server. Ajax
                enabled JavaScript to send requests and receive responses from a server, allowing content to be updated
                in real time.</li>
            <li>XML
                When the term Ajax was originally coined, XML documents were often used to return data. Many
                different types of data can be sent, but by far the most commonly used in Ajax nowadays is JSON,
                which is more lightweight and easier to parse than XML. (Although it has never really taken off, the
                term Ajaj is sometimes used to describe the technique.) JSON also has the advantage of being
                natively supported in JavaScript, so you can deal with JavaScript objects rather than having to
                parse XML files using DOM methods.</li>
            <li>Redirect() is a method that redirects to another URL</li>
            <li>Text() is a method that reads text and returns a promise</li>
            <li>Blob() is a method that is used to read a file of raw data, it then returns a promise that resolves with
                a blob object</li>
            <li>JSON responses - json() method transforms JSON data into a promise and resolves it to a JavaScript
                object</li>
            <li>AJAX can receive and send information in many different formats, however it is usually a JSON string
                when sending</li>
            <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to submit information using AJAX</li>
        </ul>
